<h2># What is ZN</h2>

<p>
The basic principle of ZN Framework is to let users write simple and readable codes. Because of this principle, our libraries are built by using both dynamic and static access methods with a Powerful Autoloading Architecture.

In general, we have tried to stay on PSR coding standarts but at same points our vision made us to stay away on some of them.

Development of ZN Framework with the principle of SIMPLICITY grows each day further. We give importance of Developers for not forced to use different structures from 3rd party sources while developing and integrating structures.

Because we believe on easy, simple and readable codes for Developers, receiving feedbacks will make us happier to build up our further steps based on your critisms and how much we serve our targets.

Our aim is to make ZN Framework users doesn't require any other additional structures.

We are open for all kind of different opinion, suggestion and critisms as well as infrastructure of our project. We believe that ZN Framework will be placed on place where it deserves to be by your contributions!
